"""The manual_review re-snatch wedge, at the handoff seam (#562).

`manual_review` is terminal (rank 55), so a release_key that ends there used to
refuse every later grab at `handoff.reserve` — including the operator's own
`retry` / `search again`, which re-wants the issue and queues a search but
leaves the journal row terminal. That made the operator exit unreachable for
that issue+provider: the sweep retried into the same wall every SEARCH_INTERVAL
and narrated nothing.

The boundary that stays: an *unresolved* manual_review row is an open
obligation on the needs-attention band and still blocks — but it now says why.
