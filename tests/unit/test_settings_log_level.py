"""Saving the log level from Settings takes effect now, not at the next start.

``logger.configure_log_level`` has performed the live reconfigure all along;
its only caller was maintenance mode, so ``LOG_LEVEL`` was writable, invisible,
and inert until startup -- where a startup argument beat it anyway. The point
of raising verbosity is to catch a problem *while it is happening* (#610), so a
dial that needs a restart destroys the state the operator was trying to
capture.

Two fixtures, deliberately:

``stubbed_save`` stands in for the handler rebuild and covers what
``update_config`` itself decides -- parsing, refusal, ordering, persistence.
None of that depends on which logger path the process took, and the skip below
would otherwise silence all of it on any machine whose locale is not English.

``settings_save`` drives the real ``comicarr`` logger and asserts on what
actually gets *emitted*; a call-recording stub would pass against handlers that
never changed. Only those tests are skipped off the English path.
