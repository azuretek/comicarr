"""CI gate: every literal ``upsert`` table name is a key of ``TABLE_MAP``.

``db.upsert()`` resolves its table by dict lookup (``comicarr/db.py``), so a
name that is merely mis-cased — ``"Issues"`` for ``"issues"`` — type-checks,
imports, and lints clean, then raises ``ValueError: Unknown table for upsert``
the first time that branch runs. Six such literals silently broke series
refresh on a live deployment (#561): the failure only surfaces on the write
path, which is exactly the path unit tests tend not to reach.

The lookup key is a plain string, so no type can carry the constraint. An AST
scan at author time is the cheapest gate that closes the class.

Table names built at runtime (``db.upsert(updatetable, ...)``) cannot be
checked statically and are skipped — the literals are where the typo lives.

Contributor-facing only — no changeset (CLAUDE.md).

Wire-in: ``npm run lint:guards``.
