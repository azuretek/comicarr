# Runtime context ownership

`AppContext` is the one runtime owner for a Comicarr process. It is created
once by `comicarr.app.core.runtime.create_runtime()` after `comicarr.initialize`
has loaded configuration, applied schema readiness checks, and decrypted or
generated startup secrets. `Comicarr.py` creates it before `comicarr.start()`
can start a scheduler or worker. FastAPI lifespan attaches that existing
instance to `app.state.ctx`; it does not construct a second view.

## Ownership contract

| State category | Examples | Creation/writer | Reader/shutdown owner | Identity rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Immutable configuration | paths, `config`, build metadata | startup configuration | routes/services; no disposal | fixed after factory creation |
| Long-lived services | scheduler, CV session/cache, Metron, AI bundle, event bus | runtime factory; event loop is attached in lifespan | workers/routes; lifespan closes clients after drain | one instance per process |
| Queues and locks | `ddl_queued`, all work queues, search/API/DDL locks, acquisition resume lock | existing bootstrap objects adopted by factory | workers, scheduler, routes; lifespan signals queues then drains pools | must be the exact same object, never a copy |
| Request-visible state | scheduler status, setup/JWT state, import progress, version state | migrated services write with `set_runtime_field()` | system/API readers; discarded with process | bridge serializes migrated writes with `runtime_lock` |
| Durable-acquisition projection | schema readiness, maintenance block reason, migration reconciliation | `MaintenanceController` database transactions/fences, then runtime projection | startup diagnostics and acquisition workers | durable DB fence is authoritative; context is its live projection |
| Legacy compatibility | module aliases and worker-pool references | `runtime.py` projection while legacy engines remain | unmigrated legacy code only | aliases share object identities; mutable data is never cloned |

## Lifecycle

1. `comicarr.initialize()` establishes config, schema/migration state, and
   secrets. A schema or maintenance failure closes the acquisition gate but
   still permits authenticated diagnostics.
2. `create_runtime()` adopts the initialized objects exactly once and projects
   the same identities to temporary legacy aliases. It also builds the AI
   client bundle at this lifecycle boundary.
3. `comicarr.start(runtime)` rejects a missing or divergent context before
   starting scheduler/worker activity. Worker pool references are written
   through the compatibility bridge so the shutdown owner sees the same pools.
4. FastAPI lifespan stores that instance on `app.state.ctx`, sets the event-bus
   loop, and re-reads the durable acquisition gate.
5. Lifespan shutdown stops scheduling, signals queues, joins worker pools off
   the event loop, closes external clients, disposes the database, then marks
   the context disposed. `get_context()` fails closed after that point.

## Transitional boundary

The system router, acquisition maintenance gate, `weeklypullit` state writer,
and the bounded AI runtime consumers are the first migrated ownership boundary.
`tests/unit/test_runtime_context.py` keeps an explicit allowlist for direct
`comicarr.<UPPERCASE>` accesses in those files; it is empty. The larger
`app/system/service.py` scheduler surface and non-selected domains remain
documented compatibility consumers until their coherent ownership waves,
rather than being silently rewritten in this change.
